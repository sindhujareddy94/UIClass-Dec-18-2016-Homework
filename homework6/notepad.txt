1)	different types in css? 
CSS comes in three types:
External style sheet: in a separate file
Internal style sheet: at the top of each web page document
Inline style: right next to the text it decorates
External style sheets are separate files full of CSS instructions (with the file extension .css). Internal style places at the top of each web page document, before any of the content is listed. Inline styles placed right where you need them, next to the text or graphic you wish to decorate. We can insert inline styles anywhere in the middle of your HTML code.
2)	what is cascading in css?
Cascading means that styles can fall (or cascade) from one style sheet to another, enabling multiple style sheets to be used on one HTML document.
Even the simplest HTML document may have three or more style sheets associates with it including:
The browsers style sheet – browsers apply style to sheets to all web documents. These style sheets vary from browser to browser but they have common characteristics such as black text, blue links, purple visited links etc. these are referred to as a default browser stylesheet.
The users style sheet – A user is anyone who looks at your website. Most modern browsers allow users to set their own style sheets within their browser. These style sheets will override the browsers default style sheets for that user only.
The authors style sheet -  the author is the person who develops the website. After applying a basic style sheet or an inline style to a page, you have added what is referred to as an author style sheet. Everything you do, from choosing fonts, colors and laying out pages in css is done using author style sheets.
